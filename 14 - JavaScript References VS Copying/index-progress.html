    let age2 = age;

    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(team, players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Bob';
    console.log(team, players);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // returns a copy of the whole array

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team2[3] = 'team2-player';
    team3[3] = 'team3-player';
    team4[3] = 'team4-player';
    team5[3] = 'team5-player';

    console.log(team2, players);
    console.log(team3, players);
    console.log(team4, players);
    console.log(team5, players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        "name" : "Callum M",
        "age" : 22
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const copy = person;
    person.age = 100;
    console.log(copy, person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const updated = Object.assign({}, person, {'age': 999});
    console.log(updated, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const copy2 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const someone = {
        'name' : 'Test name',
        'age' : 33,
        'social' : {
            'twitter' : '@test',
            'facebook' : 'mr.test'
        }
    };

    const copySomeone = Object.assign({}, someone);

    copySomeone.name = 'Bob';
    console.log(copySomeone, someone); // this is good, copy updated only

    copySomeone.social.twitter = '@thingmabob';
    console.log(copySomeone, someone); // Updates both - would need to deep clone

    copyJson = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(someone));
    copyJson.social.twitter = '@jsonthing';
    console.log(copyJson, someone); // works, but questionable performance
